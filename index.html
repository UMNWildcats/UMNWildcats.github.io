  <h1>Positivty Rate Weekly Graph</h1>
  <p>September 18th 2020</p>
  <p><img src="https://umnwildcats.github.io/graph-20200918.png" alt="Graph for week 2020 Sept 18th" style="max-width:100%"></p>
  <p>See John Hopkin's explanation of how to use <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/covid-19-testing-understanding-the-percent-positive.html">positivity rate</a> to assess local heatlh risk.</p>
  <p>The standard deviation of sample proportion for the most recent week of Boynton and UMD-HS are ~2% and ~8.5% respectively.</p>
  <p>UofMN data has a large testing bias. Students are only tested if they are symptomatic or have been directly exposed to COVID-19 to recieve a test. This is despite the fact the infected young people, such as students, are usually asymptomatic. Boynton does not report student-athlete data.</p>
  <p>Testing is more restricted for faculty and staff. Faculty and staff must be on campus when they first have symptoms to receive a test.</p>
  <p>Placing barriers in the way of testing does not promote safety. Barriers to testing and thereby obscuring the impact of the virus on campus promotes the spread of COVID-19.</p>
  <p>There is a current narrative that students are responsible for preventing the spread of COVID-19 when the campus re-opens to classes this coming Monday. Ultimate responsibility for safety on campus rests on the UofMN's Administration and Board of Regents. By re-opening the campus to classes during a pandemic President Gabel's Administration has put students, faculty, staff, and Minnesotans at great risk. Restricting access to COVID-19 tests compounds the risk.</p>

<h1 id="uofmn-releases-a-covid-dashboard">UofMN Releases a COVID Dashboard</h1>
<p>August 28th 2020</p>
<p>Campus Dashboards:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://safe-campus.umn.edu/return-campus/covid-19-dashboard">Twin-Cities</a></li>
<li><a href="https://protectthenest.crk.umn.edu/">Crookston</a></li>
<li><a href="https://safe-campus.d.umn.edu/covid-dashboard">Duluth</a></li>
<li><a href="https://morris.umn.edu/covid-19-resources/covid-19-dashboard">Morris</a></li>
<li><a href="https://r.umn.edu/COVID-19-Dashboard">Rochester</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this is great news. (Much better than no data.) <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/covid-19-testing-understanding-the-percent-positive.html">A high positive percent rate indicates there is a high number of people who are infected and do not know it</a>. It is a critical stat for judging personal safety at the U.</p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t need more data! I&#39;m not sure if the UofMN has data collected from other sources or if they are allowed to release that data. During a test people are supposed to state where they go to school or work, so the state should have this data. FOIA</p>
<p>The dashboards publish COVID-19 for tests performed by the UofMN. There are two UofMN COVID-19 testing groups: Boynton (Twin-Cities campus) and UMD-HS (Duluth campus). Therefore, Crookston, Morrison, and Rochester&#39;s dashboards do not include test data.</p>
<p>Boynton test data includes (1) Number of tests, (2) Student positive cases, (3) Non-student positive cases, (4) Total positive cases, and (5) Percentage of positive cases. These data types are represented as a cumulative and weekly value. Duluth is similar, but does not include non-student data.</p>
<p>As it appears now, only the cumulative and weekly data is reported. It is unknown if historical data will be provided next week, which is important for accurate reporting. Most COVID-19 tests cannot be read immediately, so tests administered near the end of the week may not be reported. To address this, The Weekly COVID-19 Report from the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) the most recent week is highlighted as subject to change and updated in future reports.</p>
<p><img src="./graph.png" alt="MDH Graph"></p>
<p>Also, all campus dashboards include usage data for dorm rooms set aside for students living on campus to isolate or quarantine.</p>
<p><a href="./umn-covid-dashboards.csv">This spreadsheet</a> will record data published to the UofMN dashboards. It also includes the weekly percentage of positives cases for Minnesota as reported by the MDH.</p>
<p>Two questions I have about the data is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does Duluth offer COVID-19 tests to faculty and staff?</li>
<li>What is the maximum number of COVID-19 tests that Boynton and UMD-HS can handle on a weekly basis?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hiding-covid-data-from-the-public">Hiding COVID Data from the Public</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Deputy Director for the UMN&#39;s Center for Infections Disease Resaerch and Policy (CIDRAP), <strong>Jill DeBoer</strong>, pushed back against reporting University COVID data publicly, because the data would be incomplete. Essential, <strong>Jill DeBoer</strong> claimed that the data would under represent the total number of cases and therefore should not be published at all. Her arguments are all red herrings. Data sets are rarely perfect. <a href="https://twitter.com/cidrap">@CIDRAP</a> researchers understand this. Why does <strong>President Gabel&#39;s</strong> administration want to hide COVID data?</p>
<p>&quot;I think [reporting public COVID data] is fairly simple. Number of tests given. Number of positive tests received. Let&#39;s not hide the data from the students who&#39;s data is being used for the material. Let&#39;s not underestimate the public and student&#39;s ability to manage and understand the data and the limitations of the data.&quot; - <strong>Regent Richard Beeson</strong> #UMNProud</p>

<h3 id="pivot-proposal-s-disingenuous-riders">Pivot Proposal&#39;s Disingenuous Riders</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UMN President Gabel&#39;s</strong> COVID &quot;Pivot&quot; proposal disingenuously combines two issues: (1) opening the UMN to on-campus learning and (2) delaying the on-campus student move in date. <strong>Gabel</strong> frames the move-in delay as a fairness and safety issue. The proposal passed 8-3.</p>
<p><strong>Regent Jane Mayeron</strong> voiced that it was important to vote on each issues in <strong>President Gabel&#39;s</strong> COVID Pivot proposal separately. <strong>Regent Beeson</strong> and <strong>Rosha</strong> also showed interest separate votes, but when pushed <strong>Regent Mayeron</strong> did not make a motion to split the question. This despite her stated belief that risks implied in the proposal would not just be to individuals, but to the community at large. <strong>Regent Mayeron</strong> voted for the joint proposal.</p>
<p><strong>President Gabel</strong> believes it would be unfair for students to move in before on-campus learning begins because, they would not have access to normal residential amenities, like the gymnasium and student dining halls. #UMNSafety</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBFLX2Fs2U4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=7822">UofM <strong>Regent Chair Kendall Powell</strong> scuttled <strong>Regent Hsu&#39;s</strong> motion for a vote to make the UMN COVID data public. <strong>Jill DeBoer</strong> offered more red herrings to hide data on behalf of <strong>President Gabriel</strong>.</a></p>

<h3 id="student-chair">Student Chair</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When we think not just about this decision but, the pandemic at large, we have to remember that getting this wrong means people dying. We know the slides of the financial impacts, peoples college experience at stake, but that&#39;s not it. We have to bring it back to, &quot;it&#39;s a pandemic&quot; and the currency is lives here.&quot;, <strong>Regent Mike Kenyanya</strong> said before voting for the proposal to allow on-campus teaching.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBFLX2Fs2U4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5277">UofM <strong>Regent Sviggum</strong> flippantly asked that if a majority of the population will be infected with COVID, why not just live life as normal? #UMNSafety</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XBFLX2Fs2U4?t=5492">#UMN <strong>Regent Sviggum</strong> is not concerned with the personal health risk of COVID to students, since they are young. <strong>Sviggum</strong> then states that health experts would attribute the true risk of young people catching COVID to them transmitting the virus. He then attacks the panels health expert, <strong>Dr. Osterholm</strong>, for not condemning transmission during the George Floyd protest.</a></p>
<p><strong>Sviggum</strong> clearly understands that health experts are concerned with young people, like students, spreading COVID, but he would rather make personal attacks against those experts than deal with the safety of Minnesotans. #UMNShame</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XBFLX2Fs2U4?t=8933">UofM <strong>Regent Sviggum</strong> is not acting in a fashion that is exercising reasonable care in his responsibilities to keep students and our community safe.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XBFLX2Fs2U4?t=5539"><strong>Sviggum</strong> ridiculed the panels health expert, <strong>Dr. Michael Osterholm</strong>, for his concern over COVID transmission during the Stergies Bike Rally, but that &quot;chaos in protests were not held up to the same health concerns&quot;. The UMN Board of <strong>Regents Chair Kendall Powell</strong> did not call on <strong>Dr. Osterholm</strong> to respond to <strong>Sviggum</strong> racist analogy.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2012/03/08/sviggum-dayton-embarrassment"><strong>Sviggum</strong> should resign from the University Board or Regents, again.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XBFLX2Fs2U4?t=5492">Later, <strong>Sviggum</strong> commented that this isn&#39;t the first time that there was &quot;significant chaos in higher education&quot; and refers to the &quot;chaos&quot; of the civil rights and antiwar movement.</a></p>

<h3 id="mcmillan-judges-covid-pandemic-locally">McMillan judges COVID Pandemic locally</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UMN&#39;s Board of Regent&#39;s David McMillan</strong> believes that decisions for a pandemic should be based on LOCAL, specifically &quot;Upper-Midwest&quot;, data. If <strong>McMillan</strong> does not understand the definition and implications of a PANDEMIC he should not be making these decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>👀 shoehorning cherry picked data for future decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Chair, <strong>Kendall Powell</strong>, praised and embraced <strong>McMillan&#39;s</strong> pandemic analysis.</p>

<h3 id="regent-worry-over-legal-liability">Regent Worry over Legal Liability</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBFLX2Fs2U4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8667"><strong>Regent McMillan</strong> is concerned with the legal liability between language in the UMN housing contract and student &quot;risks&quot;. Particularly, when it comes to their parents.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XBFLX2Fs2U4?t=8933">To <strong>Regent McMillan&#39;s</strong> legal concern, <strong>UMN&#39;s General Council</strong> stated that it wasn&#39;t so much a contract law issue, but a legal question of what responsibilities the UMN Board of Regents has to keep students &amp; the community safe and are the regents acting in a fashion that exercises reasonable care. The <strong>Council</strong> emphasised focusing on reasonable care.</a></p>
<p><strong>Chair Kendall Powell</strong> interpreted the <strong>Council&#39;s</strong> advice as: &quot;It&#39;s a public health issue we are focusing on and what is our duty in that regard.&quot; By their words and actions, public health was not a major concern of those who voted for <strong>President Gabel&#39;s</strong> proposal.</p>
